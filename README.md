# Simple native script test
Please ignore. Or clone it, I don't really care :B
This is really just a test with readme.md markup and nativescript

## Quick Start

```
tns run android
```

**NB:** Hum...

## Structure

### Architecture
The application root component is located at:
- `app-root.xml` - sets up a Frame that lets you navigate between pages.

There is a single blank component located in:
- `/home/home-page.js` - sets up an empty page layout.

Try [joining the NativeScript community Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation). The Slack channel is a great place to get help troubleshooting problems, as well as connect with other NativeScript developers.

If you have found an issue with this template, please report the problem in the [NativeScript repository](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues).
